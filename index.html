<p>Here I share my mapping story and things I have learnt in the osgeo space. It is a journey I have enjoyed and would love to share with the world. In my mapping adventure I have travelled to interesting places, I have met incredible people, and learnt a lot. But all of it would go to waste if I dont share it. Enjoy!</p>

<p>My OpenStreetMap story starts on Friday 15th June 2012 when I participated in a mapping challenge organised by Fruits of Thought an NGO based in Muyenga a Suburb of Kampala. Here I met Douglas, Kim and Ketty who introduced me to OpenStreetMap, the free editable map of the world. I fell in love with it from the word go, thanks to my teachers. It was my first of the many to follow Mapping Days which involved moving around with GPS units, and Walking Papers collecting data then editing the map using Potlach an online editor that was the most popular by then. The half day event, was followed by 3 weeks of remote mapping which were used to determine the best three.</p>

<p>The top three winners of the Mapping Challenge were to go for a road trip around Uganda. I love travelling and this was my chance to discover more of my beautiful country Uganda. But this wasn't any ordinary road trip, our task was to map with 5 Universities from all over Uganda. From Uganda Christian University Mbale, to Gulu University, to Uganda Pentecostal University Fortportal, to Mbarara University of Science and Technolgy ending with Uganda Martyrs University Nkozi. It was a trip full of adventure, with Ketty, Douglas and Julius we shared a lot of fun moments. In the two weeks that the trip lasted, I evolved from an OpenStreetMap beginner to Intermediate to a Trainer, learning and discovering more tools and OSM use cases.</p><h3>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
